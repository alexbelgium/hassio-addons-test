## About

---

[Ubooquity by vaemendis](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/) is a free, lightweight and easy-to-use home server for your comics and ebooks developed . This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-ubooquity) from [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/).

Ubooquity supports many types of files, with a preference for ePUB, CBZ, CBR and PDF files. Metadata from library management software Calibre and ComicRack are also supported. Ubooquity lets you create user accounts and set access rights for each shared folder.

This addons has several configurable options :

- allowing to mount local external drive, or smb share from the addon (decreases performance)
- **VERY IMPORTANT, CAN CRASH SYSTEM** : Setting of the maximum RAM usage for java. The quantity of memory allocated to Ubooquity depends on the hardware your are running it on. If this quantity is too small, you might sometime saturate it with when performing memory intensive operations and you'll get "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space errors". If the quantity allocated is too high for your system, it will crash home assistant and you'll need to manually reboot. Value is a number of megabytes ( put just a number, without MB).

It is recommended to enable OPDS server from option, then you can connect to your comics/eBook server from a mobile app (I use [Chunky](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/chunky-comic-reader/id663567628) on iOS (paid), [Kuboo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sethchhim.kuboo&hl=fr&gl=US) on android (free))
