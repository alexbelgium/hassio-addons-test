## About

---

[Scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) is a Hard Drive Health Dashboard & Monitoring solution, merging manufacturer provided S.M.A.R.T metrics with real-world failure rates. This addon is based on the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/scrutiny) from [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/).

Features :

- SMART monitoring
- Automatic addition of local drives
- Hourly updates
- Ingress with/without ssl
- Automatic upstream updates

## Installation

---

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other add-on.

1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your home assistant instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Set the add-on options to your preferences
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the webUI (Ingress based) and adapt the software options

## Configuration

---

Webui can be found at <http://your-ip:8080>, or through Ingress.
It automatically mounts all local drives.

```yaml
GUID: user
GPID: user
ssl: true/false (for Ingress)
certfile: fullchain.pem #ssl certificate
keyfile: privkey.pem #sslkeyfile
```

# Integration in home assistant

---

Integration with HA can be done with the [rest platform](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest) in configuration.yaml.

Two types of api endpoints are available:

- Summary data : http://YOURIP:ADDONPORT/api/summary
- Detailed data : http://YOURIP:ADDONPORT/api/WWN/details

For the detailed data, wmn can be found for each hdd within the scrutiny app. For example for me : http://192.168.178.23:8086/api/device/0x50014ee606c14537/details

Example to get data from the first hdd.

```yaml
rest:
  - verify_ssl: false
    scan_interval: 60
    resource: http://YOURIP:ADDONPORT/api/summary
    sensor:
      - name: "HDD disk 1"
        json_attributes_path: "$.data[0].smart_results[0]"
        value_template: "OK"
        json_attributes:
          - "device_wwn"
          - "date"
          - "smart_status"
          - "temp"
          - "power_on_hours"
          - "power_cycle_count"
          - "ata_attributes"
          - "nvme_attributes"
          - "scsi_attributes"
```
