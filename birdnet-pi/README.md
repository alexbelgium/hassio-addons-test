## About

---

[birdnet-pi](https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi) is an AI solution for continuous avian monitoring and identification originally developed by @mcguirepr89 on github (https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi), whose work is continued by @Nachtzuster and other developers on an active fork (https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi)

Features of the addon :
- Robust base image provided by [linuxserver](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-debian)
- Working docker system thanks to https://github.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement
- Uses HA pulseaudio server
- Uses HA tmpfs to store temporary files in ram and avoid disk wear
- Exposes all config files to /config to allow remanence and easy access
- Allows to modify the location of the stored bird songs (preferably to an external hdd)
- Supports ingress, to allow secure remote access without exposing ports

## Configuration

Install, then start the addon a first time
Webui can be found at <http://homeassistant:80>.

You'll need a microphone : either use one connected to HA or the audio stream of a rstp camera.

Options can be configured through three ways :

- Addon options

```yaml
BIRDSONGS_FOLDER: folder to store birdsongs file # It should be an ssd if you want to avoid clogging of analysis
BIRDS_ONLINE_INFO: uses either allaboutbird (US birds in english) or ebird (universal and translated) to provide online information
SPECIES_CONVERTER: if yes, you need to put in the file /config/convert_species_list.txt the list of species you want to convert (example : Falco subbuteo_Faucon hobereau;Falco tinnunculus_Faucon Crécerelle). It will convert on the fly the specie when detected
TZ: Etc/UTC specify a timezone to use, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List
ssl: true/false
certfile: fullchain.pem #ssl certificate, must be located in /ssl. Generated by let's encrypt addon ; but you can also use yours
keyfile: privkey.pem #sslkeyfile, must be located in /ssl. Generated by let's encrypt addon ; but you can also use yours.
pi_password: set the user password to access the web terminal
localdisks: sda1 #put the hardware name of your drive to mount separated by commas, or its label. ex. sda1, sdb1, MYNAS...
networkdisks: "//SERVER/SHARE" # optional, list of smb servers to mount, separated by commas
cifsusername: "username" # optional, smb username, same for all smb shares
cifspassword: "password" # optional, smb password
cifsdomain: "domain" # optional, allow setting the domain for the smb share
```

- Config.yaml
Additional variables can be configured using the config.yaml file found in /config/db21ed7f_birdnet-pi/config.yaml using the Filebrowser addon

- Config_env.yaml
Additional environment variables can be configured there

## Installation

---

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other add-on.

1. Add my add-ons repository to your home assistant instance (in supervisor addons store at top right, or click button below if you have configured my HA)
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexbelgium%2Fhassio-addons)
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Set the add-on options to your preferences
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the webUI and adapt the software options

## Integration with HA

You can use apprise to send notifications with mqtt, then act on those using HomeAssistant
Further informations : https://wander.ingstar.com/projects/birdnetpi.html

## Using ssl

Option 1 : Install let's encrypt addon, generate certificates. They are by default certfile.pem and keyfile.pem stored in /ssl. Just enable ssl from the addon option and it will work.

Option 2 : Use caddy's default ssl but then it requires the external port 80 or 443 to be mapped
