## About

---

[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is the distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine at the heart of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/). 
You can use Elasticsearch to store, search, and manage data for:
- Logs
- Metrics
- A search backend
- Application monitoring
- Endpoint security
... and more!

To learn more about Elasticsearchâ€™s features and capabilities, see their [product page](https://www.elastic.co/fr/elasticsearch/) .

Here, this addon is used to single node that can be called from other addons needing it.
