# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Spotweb

[Spotweb][spotweb] is a decentralized usenet community based on the [Spotnet][spotnet] protocol. Please support the developers of this software at
[spotweb].

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Make sure that the MariaDB addon is installed or use a remote MySQL server.
1. Install the Spotweb add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Carefully configure the add-on to your preferences, see the official documentation for for that.

This addon will automatically configure and create the database. These steps can be skipped following the official documentation.
All you have to do: enter your usenet server details and your download client (eg: nzbget).

## Configuration Spotweb

The official documentation mentions:
Please run 'http://yourdomain.com/install.php' from within your browser before attempting anything further with Spotweb and make sure all items are checked 'OK'.
These steps can be skipped as this addon will automatically configure and create the database.

All you have to do: enter your usenet server details and your download client (eg: nzbget).

**Note**: Spots are retrieved via an hourly cron job. It can take up to an hour before the spots start appearing.
Depending on the specs of your system, it can take more than 24 hours before all spots are retrieved.

## Configuration Addon

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
ssl: false
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface of Bookstack
Panel. Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `remote_mysql_host`

If using an external database, the hostname/address for the MYSQL/MariaDB
database.

### Option: `remote_mysql_database`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the name of the database.

### Option: `remote_mysql_username`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the username with permissions.

### Option: `remote_mysql_password`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the password of the above user.

### Option: `remote_mysql_port`

Only applies if a remote MYSQL database is used, the port that the database
server is listening on.

## Database usage

By default, spotweb will automatically use and configure the Home Assistant
MariaDB addon which should be installed prior to startup, this can be changed
within the configuration to use an external MySql/MariaDB Database. Please note
that there is no easy upgrade path between the two options.

## Known issues and limitations

When configuring the download client (NZB handling), 'addon_62c7908d_nzbget_docker' is automatically filled in as hostname of nzbget.
You'll have to lookup the correct hostname of your nzbget addon. It is usually 'local-nzbget'.
