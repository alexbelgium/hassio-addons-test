## About

[Tdarr](https://tdarr.io) is a closed-source distributed transcoding system for automating media library transcode/remux management and making sure your files are exactly how you need them to be in terms of codecs/streams/containers and so on. Put your spare hardware to use with Tdarr Nodes for Windows, Linux (including Linux arm) and macOS.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hurlenko/Tdarr) from hurlenko.
