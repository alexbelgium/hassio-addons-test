## About

Forked to add latest beta versions, smb and local hdd mount.

- Inital version : https://github.com/petersendev/hassio-addons
- CIFS code : https://github.com/dianlight/hassio-addons

[plex](https://plex.media/) organizes video, music, live TV, and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone plex Media Server.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-plex) from linuxserver.io.

## Configuration
